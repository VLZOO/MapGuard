# üõ°Ô∏è MapGuard ‚Äî Your World's Last Line of Defense

**MapGuard** is not just another backup plugin. It's your server's shield against chaos. Whether it's a crash, a grief attack, or a misclick from an admin ‚Äî MapGuard makes sure your worlds stay safe, recoverable, and protected.

> **Compatibility note:** MapGuard fully supports Slime-World-Manager (SWM).  
> Official SWM repository: https://github.com/cijaaimee/Slime-World-Manager

## üöÄ What MapGuard Does Best

- Protects normal Bukkit/Spigot worlds and SlimeWorldManager `.slime` files.  
- Minimizes data loss from sudden shutdowns and crashes with frequent, safe saves.  
- Provides fast, reliable ZIP backups that can be created without killing TPS.  
- Prevents abuse with permission checks and per-player cooldowns for heavy operations.  
- Gives clean, colorized admin feedback so you always know the server's state.

## ‚ú® Core Features

### Crash Recovery
- Crash detection and admin alerts when the server restarts without a clean shutdown.  
- Periodic auto-save of all worlds to reduce lost progress.  
- Thread-safe saving: normal worlds saved compatibly on the main thread; heavier tasks handled safely.

### Reliable Backups
- ZIP backups for normal worlds and `.slime` files.  
- Asynchronous backup execution to avoid TPS impact.  
- Built-in cooldown (default 60s) for `/mapguard backup all` to prevent spam and abuse.

### SlimeWorldManager Support
- Full support for `.slime` files and SWM workflows.  
- `/mapguard preload <slimeName>` loads a slime world and (optionally) teleports the player to spawn.  
- Auto-detects slime folder if `slimeworld-path` is not configured.  
- **Works with the Slime-World-Manager project:** MapGuard integrates with SWM (see https://github.com/cijaaimee/Slime-World-Manager) so admins can backup, save, preload, and manage slime worlds seamlessly alongside normal worlds.

### Permission-First Design
- Granular permissions for all sensitive actions; help and tab-completion are filtered by permissions.  
- `mapguard.admin` convenience bundle for full access while keeping fine-grained controls available.

### Admin Experience & Crash Detection
- `/mapguard reload` applies config changes without restarting the server.  
- **Crash Detection Workflow:** on startup MapGuard checks for an unclean shutdown flag or missing clean-stop marker. If a crash is detected it:
  - Immediately logs a clear, timestamped alert to console and server log.  
  - Sends an in-game admin notification (permission-checked) listing which worlds were last saved and the recommended recovery actions.  
  - Optionally triggers an automatic backup of current world files to a timestamped ZIP to preserve post-crash state (configurable).  
  - Records a recovery entry in MapGuard logs so admins can review the crash timeline and any automatic actions taken.  
- **Quick Recovery Actions:** dedicated commands and suggested steps appear in the alert so admins can restore from the latest safe backup or run targeted saves/backups without hunting through logs.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

1. Place `MapGuard.jar` into your server's `/plugins` folder.  
2. Restart the server.  
3. (Optional) Edit `config.yml` to set `slimeworld-path` or other preferences. If omitted, MapGuard auto-detects `slime_worlds`.  
4. Grant permissions via your permission plugin.

## üí° Best Practices ‚Äî Keep your map safe during attacks

- Restrict save/backup permissions to trusted admin roles only.  
- Keep an off-site copy of important backups (remote storage or sync).  
- Pair MapGuard with anti-grief (CoreProtect), anti-cheat, and network-level protections for layered defense.  
- Monitor logs and enable webhook/Discord notifications for backup and crash events.

## üöÄ Quick Examples

Save everything:  
`/mapguard save all`

Backup everything:  
`/mapguard backup all`

Preload a slime world:  
`/mapguard preload arena_world`
